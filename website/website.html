        The widespread use of computer technology brings many opportunities but there are associated risks that need to be considered.
        Moreover, there are many moral and ethical issues - from the privacy of data and information, to when could artificial intelligence endanger society. As a result, there are many nationwide
        and worldwide legal legislations to incriminate those who are unethically or wrongfully using computers, for instance, those who start network and malware attacks; those who improperly handle data by not keeping data relevant and non-excessive.
        Examples of such legislations are:
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li>  'Computer Misuse Act (1990)' - which makes it an offence to access or modify computer material without permission; it makes it an offence make, supply, or obtain anything which can be used in further computer misuse offences. This
          The act was originally created to ensure that 'computer hacking' was covered by law, but has since been frequently updated to ensure it remains relevant. <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/18/contents" target="_blank">Click for further information.</a></li>

        <li>  'Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (2000)' - which allows the police and certain government departments with the rights to carry out investigation and surveillance, such as, by demanding ISPs
            provide access to a customer's communications, allow mass surveillance of communications, and to allow monitoring of an individual's internet activities. For
            example, the Secret Service can legally wire-trap online conversations in the interests of national security provided that a warrant has been issued. This act is particularly controversial as its powers
            extend to small agencies like local councils. In addition, some people feel that the act is an invasion of privacy, or that it is often improperly used. <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/contents" target="_blank">Click for further information.</a></li>

        <li>  'The Data Protection Act 1998' - This act, which only applies to the UK, has been updated and replaced by the EU GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) which applies to all EU citizens and any company
          which withholds data of EU Citizens. The DPA applies to information stored on computers and in organised paper filings. The DPA had eight central provisions:
          <ul>
          <li>	Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully
          <li>	Personal data shall be obtained only for one or more specified and lawful purpose </li>
          <li>	Personal data shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive for its purpose(s)</li>
          <li>	Personal data shall be accurate and where necessary kept up to date</li>
          <li>	Personal data shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for its purpose(s)</li>
          <li>	Personal data shall be processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects
          	  under this Act</li>
          <li>	Appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be taken against
          	  unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or
          	  destruction of, or damage to, personal data</li>
          <li>	Personal data shall not be transferred to a country or territory outside the European
          	  Economic Area, unless that country or territory
          	  ensures an adequate level of data protection</li>
            </ul>
            <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents" target="_blank">Click for further information.</a>

            </ul>

          <h1 id="body2"> computers in the workforce </h1>
          <p>
              Over the past decade, there has been growing speculation about how computers will
              impact the world economy, in particular our jobs. Currently, almost all businesses depend
              on computers to perform certain functions but there is growing uncertainty as to the effects
              of a completely computerised society and the likelihood of this. <br><br>

              There are many advantages to involving computers in the workforce, which is why they are
              key to modern businesses. First, they improve efficiency. For companies such as Amazon
              and Effidence, machines have successfully been used to reduce delivery times and speed
              up manufacturing processes, thus improving customer satisfaction and reducing unit
              labour costs which feed through as lower prices for consumers. While Amazon uses robots
              in their warehouses to package and transfer goods between stations, Effidenceâ€™s PostBot
              is able to navigate through neighbourhoods to deliver letters and parcels from
              door-to-door. Another advantage of these computerised roles is that they reduce strain on
              workers and reduce the need to work in a repetitive and tedious environment. <br><br>

              On the other hand, this has resulted in a number of people losing their jobs, creating high
              levels of structural unemployment. The effects of this may not necessarily be long-term as
              it is likely that higher consumer demand due to cheaper services will create employment in
              other sections of the business. For the effects to be made less severe, governments must
              invest in providing retraining programmes so people are able to change occupation. The
              question is whether this is enough to counteract the effects of computerisation.<br><br>

              Computerisation has hit middle-income manufacturing jobs the hardest, where entire
              production lines within factories have been replaced by robots. As such, there has been a
              shift toward low-income service jobs. More recently, computers have been used to replace
              workers in occupations other than manufacturing, including library assistants and taxi
              drivers. This suggests more jobs are at risk than the repetitive jobs commonly associated
              with automation. One of the major downsides to a significantly computerised workplace is
              a high dependence on them; if something goes wrong, there will be a major loss of output. <br><br>
              With increased computerisation, demand for people in computing-related occupations has
              increased, as would be expected. Software developers are needed to produce working
              programs for embedded systems within smart devices and network engineers are required
              to maintain extensive networks within schools, for example. As a result of computers
              generally becoming an essential part of the workplace, employers are now looking for
              workers who are able to confidently and productively use computers. <br><br>

              With the Internet becoming accessible to almost everyone, there has been a rise in the
              services being offered exclusively online. Examples of this include online shopping and
              online banking services. This has reduced costs of renting out a physical space whilst
              simultaneously cutting labour costs as fewer workers are required to work as front-facing
              retail staff and bank clerks. Meanwhile, demand for delivery drivers to ship parcels and
              web developers to ensure the website is consistently functioning has grown. <br><br>

          </P>
          <h1 id="body3"> automated decision making </h1>
          <p>
              In the modern world, it has become increasingly common for decisions to be made by
              algorithms. Often these decisions have the potential to significantly affect peopleâ€™s lives
              and so the ethics of automated decision making is much debated. <br><br>
              Automated decision making is used to determine what different users should be displayed
              on their social media feeds. This may be based on usersâ€™ interactions and inferences
              about their interests based on their connections, for example. Is it important that users are
              shown important news stories or should their feed be tailored to their interests? The fear is
              that solely reinforcing peopleâ€™s interests creates a dangerous bubble in which their beliefs
              are never challenged, leading to a close-minded society. <br><br>
              In the US, algorithms have been used in the past to assess a criminalâ€™s likelihood of
              committing another crime based on a number of factors. Algorithmic decision-making has
              also been used in various application processes to determine a personâ€™s suitability for
              mortgages, loans, and jobs. Relying entirely on these algorithms could result in people
              being treated unfairly, as these algorithms do not consider extenuating circumstances and
              are unable to process information with the same consideration of contextual factors that
              humans are able to provide. <br><br>
              There is no doubt, however, that these algorithms have improved productivity and made
              certain application processes more convenient for employers. Companies are able to hire
              workers faster using algorithms which can screen candidates for certain desired qualities
              before the interview stage, for example. In driverless cars, the use of algorithmic decision
              making often means decisions are made faster than humans are capable of reacting, so
              have the potential to save lives. <br><br>
              Automated decision-making has almost taken over trading on the stock market, as it
              allows traders to look at past trends to model future changes. This sort of fast
              decision-making is also useful in plant automation systems and power distribution systems
              as various inputs can be collected and analysed to respond instantly to changes, such as
              increasing the power supply when demand is forecast to rise, for example. <br><br>
              Ultimately, algorithms must be thoroughly tested to produce a high-quality piece of
              software, free of bias against any group of people. To perform well, they must be provided
              with factually correct data. It is also important to recognise that algorithms have been
              designed by a group of software developers so cannot be assumed to be free of bias. As
              such, it is key that algorithms do not remain a black box; the decisions made must be
              justified and some level of human input is essential to ensure fairness.<br><br>
              Algorithmic decision-making in driverless cars raises ethical questions about how to decide
              who should be harmed if a scenario arises in which either a pedestrian or the driver must
              be harmed. This then raises questions about who is responsible for the consequences of
              this decision.
          </p>
          <h1 id="body4"> artificial intelligence </h1>
          <p>
              Artificial intelligence is the ability of a computer to replicate human intelligence, cognitive
              ability, and grasp abstract concepts. AI is playing a key role in furthering research in
              medicine, where it is used in expert systems to draw connections between illnesses to
              form diagnoses. <br><br>
              Expert systems, also known as knowledge-based systems, replicate the knowledge and
              experience an expert in a particular subject would have. They are made up of a knowledge
              base which consists of a set of facts and rules which are used to build an inference
              engine. This is interrogated to find diagnoses. <br><br>
              One of the most common uses of AI is neural networks which replicate biological neural
              networks. These â€˜learnâ€™ from a set of data that they are given and this knowledge can be
              applied to new data sets, in the same way a human is able to. This is used in pattern
              detection and picking up on financial fraud.  <br><br>
              AI is seen within voice recognition systems which are now common within smart home
              systems such as Google Home and Amazonâ€™s Alexa. These have increased convenience
              for people but raise questions about privacy, as they are required to be constantly
              switched on to function. <br><br>
              Again, artificial intelligence raises questions about accountability: who is responsible when
              things go wrong? If AI ever reaches a stage at which it is considered sentient, what rights
              should it have? <br><br>
          </p>
          <h1 id="body5"> evironmental effects </h1>
          <p>
              With technological devices being produced cheaply and widely, they have become
              affordable for a large proportion of the world population. The downside to this is the effect
              on the environment. The pressure of keeping up with trends coupled with the affordability
              means that people now throw away more devices than before. Some computers
              components are built of mercury and radioactive isotopes which are toxic and can
              contaminate water supplies. Often, this e-waste is shipped to third world countries with
              lower environmental standards to be disposed which is considered to be immoral and
              unacceptable.<br><br>
              With more devices around and processes becoming partially or entirely computerised,
              more electricity is required to power these devices. This requires using up our store of
              non-renewable fossil fuels which emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing
              to global warming. The rate of climate change has accelerated over the past year,
              indicating that we need to be more careful about our consumption and cut down the
              throw-away attitude when it comes to technological devices. The effects on the planet as a
              result of our consumption will go on to impact future generations as well as biodiversity.<br><br>
              Despite this, there has been a push in the UK for renewable energy which counteracts the
              effects of increased electricity consumption to an extent. Alongside new technologies,
              there has been a growth in environmentally-friendly technologies. Examples of this include
              smart home systems which use temperature sensors to determine when heating should be
              switched on and motion sensors to switch off lights when a room is empty. Personal
              computers and laptops offer â€˜Sleepâ€™ and â€˜Stand-byâ€™ features and some newly developed
              car engines are designed to prevent them from idling so reducing emissions. This
              suggests technology has the potential to offset some of the effects on the environment.<br><br>
          </p>
          <h1 id="body6"> censorship and the internet </h1>
          <p>
              Censorship is the act of suppressing the content that people are able to view, publish and
              access. Some countries use censorship to block out other political opinions. There is much
              debate about the extent to which government should be able to control what we have
              access to and decide what is best for the public. <br><br>
              In the UK, ISPs block websites with content associated with
              terrorism and extremist political beliefs. There is fear that
              censorship may be used to block out alternative political
              beliefs. At this point, censorship would not be acting to
              protect the country but rather to push a certain ideology,
              which some people consider to be unethical and
              unacceptable. <br><br>
              Many people believe in the idea of a â€˜Free Internetâ€™, where nothing is filtered at all, in line
              with the principle of freedom of speech. Indeed, Tim Berners-Lee created the internet to be
              a space where people could share and mutually benefit from resources. However most
              people agree that some extent of censorship has become necessary for national security
              purposes and to filter offensive comments and extremist propaganda.
              Censorship can also exist on a smaller level, such as within a school in which pupils may
              be prevented from accessing material deemed to be unsuitable. Within the workplace,
              censorship may be used to maintain high productivity and prevent distractions. <br><br>
            </p>
            <h1 id="body7"> monitoring behaviour </h1>
            <p>
              Computers are used to monitor peopleâ€™s behaviour in various environments. In many
              workplaces, employers monitor productivity by tracking the websites and applications
              workers are accessing and the time spent on these. <br><br>
              Surveillance systems and in particular, CCTV cameras are widely used for security
              purposes and to detect crime, from speeding to violence. This is useful for tracing and
              punishing criminal activity. Ankle monitors are another kind of surveillance device used on
              people under house arrest to track their location. While some people argue that this is
              unethical and contravenes basic human rights, others argue that this is a necessary
              measure that must be taken to put people off committing crime. <br><br>
            </p>
            <h1 id="body8"> analysis of personal information </h1>
            <p>
              Companies have recently become aware of the value of data, which can reveal key
              insights about people and their behaviours. Large amounts of data from a number of
              sources, called big data, can be analysed to make inferences about peopleâ€™s behaviour,
              likes and dislikes, for example. This process is called data mining and can be used to
              inform personalised political propaganda, targeted advertising or alternatively, to identify
              previously unknown connections between two variables. <br><br>
              There is some concern, however, that insights from personal information could reveal
              things that act against certain individuals. A common example is data mining uncovering
              that a certain individual is at high risk of developing a particular disease. With this
              information, an insurance company may deny them insurance or charge a higher premium.
              This raises ethical questions about whether companies uncovering these trends have a
              responsibility to feed this information back to users. <br><br>
              Although companies are legally required to state what kinds
              of data they are collecting from you, this may not always be
              obvious to users. There is pressure on large firms to be
              more transparent about the data they collect and making it
              clearer what it will be used for. The Data Protection Act
              developed in 1998 is no longer sufficient when it comes to
              protecting public welfare which is why the GDPR has been
              enforced as of May 2018.  <br><br>
            </p>
            <h1 id="body9"> piracy and offensive communications </h1>
            <p>
              Piracy is the unauthorised copying of content, such as software or media including music
              and films. This is a form of theft and is illegal; although the Internet has made it easier than
              ever before to source these types of content online, it is up to the individual to make the
              decision as to whether or not this is ethically correct. <br><br>
              While the Internet has opened up countless positive pathways for the betterment of
              society, it also provides a seemingly anonymous front for people. Offensive
              communication refers to any sort of online harassment, including cyber-bullying or stalking.
              The Malicious Communications Act introduced in 1998 makes it a criminal offence to send
              indecent or offensive messages to anyone online and as such, this sort of behaviour can
              be traced by law enforcement organisations and result in a criminal record.<br><br>

            <h1 id="body10"> ui design considerations - layout, colour paradgims and character sets </h1>
            <p>
            <b>  Layout </b> <br>
                  When web developers design websites, it is important that they consider who will be
                  viewing the website and ensure the website is designed to accommodate for all of these
                  people. The Equality Act introduced in 2010 makes it illegal to discriminate against
                  providing a service to a certain group of people, which makes this even more important.
                  Websites must be laid out in a way that makes it easy for users to navigate between
                  pages. Menus are a common tool used to provide function and in English-speaking
                  countries, menus are displayed on the left-hand side of the page. In countries such as
                  Egypt or the UAE, where Arabic is the primary language, these menus may instead be
                  displayed on the right-hand side of the page as Arabic is read from right to left. These sort
                  of design considerations must be made by developers in order to make websites
                  accessible to all people. This is particularly important for online stores, as a well laid-out
                  website which is easy-to-navigate will attract more customers.
                  Websites must also be designed in a way that makes them accessible to people with
                  visual impairments or other disabilities. Some people may need to enlarge text or alter the
                  contrast in order to view the contents of the website comfortably and a good website will
                  cater for this. Websites should provide alternative text (alt text) for images and provide a
                  screen magnifier option so people with visual impairments are not disadvantaged.
                  Transcripts of audio files should be provided for those with hearing impairments. <br><br>
            <b>  Colour Paradigms </b> <br>
                  When choosing a colour scheme for a website, web developers must take into account
                  how different colours are interpreted around the world. Some colours are regarded as
                  unlucky in certain cultures and have other negative connotations. For example, while white
                  is associated with mourning in the Middle East, it is associated with purity in Western
                  cultures. Typically, a neutral colour scheme with widely positive connotations will be
                  chosen, such as green which represents luck and nature. <br><br>
            <b>  Character Sets </b> <br>
                  In order to make websites accessible to as wide an
                  audience as possible, the contents must be translated into
                  multiple languages. Some character sets are too small to
                  accommodate all of the characters of a language. ASCII
                  only uses seven bits and so is unable to represent all of the
                  characters in the Chinese language. Therefore Unicode is
                  the preferred character set as it is able to represent over a
                  million characters. <br><br>
